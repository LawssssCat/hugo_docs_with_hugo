# Host on Cloudflare Pages

[https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-cloudflare-pages/](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-cloudflare-pages/)

Cloudflare Pages can host your Hugo site with CDN, continuous deployment, 1-click HTTPS, an admin GUI, and its own environment variables.

[Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/) are super fast, always up-to-date, and deployed directly from your Git provider (currently supports only GitHub and GitLab).

Cloudflare Pages docs have a detailed tutorial on [how to deploy a Hugo site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/).
