# i18n

[https://gohugo.io/functions/i18n/](https://gohugo.io/functions/i18n/)

Translates a piece of content based on your i18n configuration files.

## 语法

```
i18n KEY
T KEY
lang.Translate KEY
```

This translates a piece of content based on your `i18n/en-US.toml` files. You can use the [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) tools to manage your translations. The translations can exist in both the theme and at the root of your repository.

```go-html-template
{{ i18n "translation_id" }}
```

`T` is an alias to `i18n`. E.g. `{{ T "translation_id" }}`.

### Query a flexible translation with variables 

Often you will want to use the page variables in the translation strings. To do so, pass the `.` context when calling `i18n`:

```go-html-template
{{ i18n "wordCount" . }}
```

The function will pass the `.` context to the `"wordCount"` id:

i18n/en-US.

=== "yaml"

    ``` yaml
    wordCount:
      other: This article has {{ .WordCount }} words.
    ```

=== "toml"

    ``` toml
    [wordCount]
      other = 'This article has {{ .WordCount }} words.'
    ```

=== "json"

    ``` json
    {
       "wordCount": {
          "other": "This article has {{ .WordCount }} words."
       }
    }
    ```



Assume `.WordCount` in the context has value is 101. The result will be:

```
This article has 101 words.
```
